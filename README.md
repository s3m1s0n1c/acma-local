# ACMA RRL MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for searching and exploring the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) Register of Radiocommunications Licences (RRL).

This server implementation is based on the [ACMA Offline RRL](https://web.acma.gov.au/offline-rrl/index.html) web application, providing a compact SQLite-based local mirror of the RRL dataset with incremental daily updates.

## Features

- **Local Mirror**: Compact SQLite database storing the full RRL dataset.
- **Smart Synchronization**: Supports full initial download and incremental daily updates (`.rrl_update` files).
- **Comprehensive Search**: Tools for searching sites, licences, and clients.
- **Technical Details**: Detailed views for sites and licences, including associated device details and equipment specs.

## Tools

- `search_sites`: Search for radio transmission sites by name or postcode.
- `get_site_details`: Get full technical details for a specific site (transmitters, receivers).
- `search_licences`: Search for radio licences by licence number.
- `get_licence_details`: Get full technical details for a specific licence, including the holder and associated devices.
- `search_clients`: Search for license holders (clients) by name or trading name.
- `get_db_status`: Check the database "as-of" date and last synchronization timestamp.
- `sync_data`: Manually trigger a data synchronization (incremental or full).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

The server can be configured via environment variables:

- `ACMA_DB_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database file (default: `./data/acma.db`).
- `ACMA_DATA_DIR`: Directory for storing downloaded/extracted data (default: `./data`).

### MCP Client Configuration

Example configuration for Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "acma-rrl": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/acma-local-redux/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "ACMA_DB_PATH": "/path/to/acma-local-redux/data/acma.db"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Maintenance

The dataset is updated daily by ACMA. To keep your local mirror fresh, you can call the `sync_data` tool periodically.

## Development

- `npm run dev`: Start the server in development mode.
- `npm run test`: Run the test suite (Jest).

## Data Source & Extraction

This project provides a local mirror of the [ACMA Register of Radiocommunications Licences (RRL)](https://www.acma.gov.au/radiocomms-licence-data). 

The server implementation now consumes ACMA's `/v1/Extracts` REST endpoint
(`https://backend.acma.gov.au/rrl/v1/Extracts`) as its source of truth for
both the full dataset and daily incremental updates. The legacy
`offline-rrl` JavaScript implementation was used to reverse-engineer the
data structures and SQL query patterns; the new manifest API replaces the
legacy 3-URL pipeline (`spectra_rrl.zip` + `datetime-of-extract.txt` +
`.rrl_update` SQL diff).

Synchronisation modes (exposed via the MCP `sync_data` tool):

- **`auto`** (default): fetches the manifest and applies any daily
  CSV-diff change-zips strictly newer than the local `meta.as_of`. Never
  pulls the full 70 MB extract on its own — safe to call from mobile or
  metered networks.
- **`full`**: force-downloads and reimports `spectra_rrl.zip`. Use this
  on first install or when `sync_data` reports `gap-exceeded` (the local
  DB is older than the manifest's ~3-day incremental window).
